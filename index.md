This is not about the Greek mythological mountain. Olympus is the tongue-in-cheek name of a mansion buried in the depths of Atherton, called home by twelve, though not gods. 

When I first left my old home in NYC, I texted a friend at Olympus (who has since moved to Boston), asking if I could stay for a week while I figured out what to do and where to live long-term. 

When I arrived, Olympians welcomed me with open arms, and I ended up staying for a month with an invitation to stay longer. I've visited a bunch since I moved to San Francisco, held back only by the long journey it involves. In a week, Olympus will transplant itself to the heart of SF. This post is an ode to the wonderful experiences I had there. It is a collection of stories:

Olympus is tucked away among millionares' mansions, at the very end of a side road over a mile long. There used to be a bus that stopped at the beginning of the road and took a turtuious route to Caltrain, but it was discontinued, due to a single Olympian being the only one who ever took it. 

Every trip in and out of Olympus was a challenge. At first, I would walk the 3.7 miles from Caltrain, tiptoeing along the border of the road, because of course there aren't sidewalks when everyone owns six cars. 

One night when I was coming back from the city, walking down the side facing cars so that I could see them even if they didn't see me, Pika got nervous that I wasn't back yet and said she'd come pick me up. I texted back insistently that I'd make it home soon, and then my phone died. I enjoyed the walk, electronics-free, especially along the last "little" road with just a sliver of moon and the twinkling stars above the bending trees to light the way. Until I bumped into MS, almost literally, who had come to find me. "Any time you need a ride," he said, "just tell me and I'll pick you up." 

Of course, I felt too awkward to take him up on that offer more than once or twice. Instead, if I wanted to be in Palo Alto, for example, I might occasionally get a ride in the morning with someone driving in to work at Palantir. Once at a Caltrain station, I could easily go anywhere else along the line. I still felt guilty and awkward about asking for a ride, even when it was coincidental with someone's usual route. So I strung together meetings across different Caltrain stations such that I could stay away for large chunks of time, until I was staying away for days on end. 

Stanford became my home base, where I would go to hang out between meetings along different Caltrain stations, where I could eat and find a bed with a friend without any trouble. Of course, the computer science courses I audited and my friends were excellent reasons to visit, but I fell into that pattern almost accidentally. In some sense, I started going back to school because it was easier than going home.
